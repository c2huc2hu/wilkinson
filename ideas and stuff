ideas and stuff

# Wilkinson ciphers


need to see whether the deciphered text looks declined. it shouldn't really matter because english is 10/10 and doesn't use prefixes for conjugation

further ideas:
- use update wordbank as we go along
- remove modern words from the dictionary to make the prior better. could scrape project gutenberg for contemporary words
- the set of words from the lookup table are mostly in alphabetical order. instead of an arbitrary list, is this a table of contents or the page headers? TODO: look up whether contemporary dictionaries had that
