I found him the man you described and was very
sorry that by my absence from Natches I have not been able
to render him all the service that I wished however I
gave orders to the parts of my dependence to complete
their provisions over on his fleet and I wrote to the 
Baron recommending him aid your friend a gentleman and a man
of consequence all which I hope will produce some favorable effects 
for him
