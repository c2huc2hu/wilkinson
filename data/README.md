# Transcribed letters

These files are transcribed versions of some of Wilkinson's letters. The original scans are available at [TODO](#).

## Folders

### `/eval`

This is an excerpt from letter on LOC p.3044-3047 (ciphertext only) and LOC p.3048-3055 (ciphertext + plaintext). 
The except starts about 2/3 of the way down p.3044 and goes to the end of p. 3045. Both ciphertext and plaintext are broken up into lines as they appear in the ciphertext (but does not start at the beginning of a line).

This ciphertext has been cleaned to fix a small number of mistakes in the original that would have been obvious to someone with the key and aligned. Despite this, some tokens are still unreadable or cropped in the plaintext, and are marked ?. Some places (e.g. North Carolina) are encrypted with one ciphertext symbol, and are written with no space in plaintext.

The except is about 500 tokens long, and should be sufficient to get reasonable accuracy numbers. 
This ciphertext is in 1078 code, which is used throughout this repo.

### `/unsolved`

These are files we don't have solutions for. 

### `/synthetic`

These are ciphertext files that we encrypted using a similar code. (TODO: detail this)

### `/toy`

These files are for running test cases to ensure functionality


## More about the cipher

Some things I noticed while doing transcription that might be helpful

- Ciphertext sometimes includes words in French (dans, pour, lui-mÃªme, etc.). Just use the English translation (examples on p.3063)
- Look out for long S (looks like the integral sign or a cursive f), older spellings (compleat, connexion, etc.)
